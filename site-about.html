                    I am a multi-disciplinary game developer currently working on an independent game project. 
                    I am an artist at heart and possess technical skills to bring anyone's vision to life.<br>
                    <br>
                    With a solid foundation in art, design, accompanied by strong technical chops, I can implement any crazy ideas that may need to be brought to life on any given day. 
                    My goal is to work on the most ambitous, innovative, potentially crazy projects that I can find or come up with.<br>
                    
                    <br>
                    I studied Illustration and Fine Art at Academy of Art University in San Francisco, CA.
                    I later changed my education to pursuing a Bachelors of Science focused on Game Programming.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am very technical and have experience working with many programming languages and domains, including C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript.
                    I have a broad range of experience and have worked on every side of game development and team sizes that range from
                    solo projects, to small teams, to 350+ people on God of War.<br>
                    <br>
                    I love working with other people, especially from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, and am always seeking 
                    opportunities to foster positive creativity and growth in the people I work with.<br>
                    <br>
                    I invest my spare time in extra education and personal projects to keep my skills sharp and up-to-date.<br>
                    <br>
                    Currently my main development interests lie in procedural generation and finding ways to make it more effective for
                    cutting down on tedious development tasks to focus on the design of games.<br>
