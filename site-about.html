                Hello, my name is Michael Nevins.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a multi-disciplinary game developer currently working on an independent game project.<br>
                I am an artist at heart and possess technical skills to bring anyone's vision to life.<br>
                <br>
                With a solid foundation in art, design, accompanied by strong technical chops, I can implement any crazy ideas that may need to be brought to life on any given day.<br>
                My goal is to work on the most ambitous, innovative, potentially crazy projects that I can find or come up with.<br>
                
                <br>
                I studied Illustration and Fine Art at Academy of Art University in San Francisco, CA.<br>
                I later changed my education to pursuing a Bachelors of Science focused on Game Programming.<br>
                <br>
                I have experience working with many programming languages and domains, including C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript.<br>
                I have a broad range of experience and have worked on every side of game development and team sizes from<br>
                solo projects, to small teams, to 350+ people on God of War.<br>
                <br>
                I love working with other people, especially from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, and am always seeking<br>
                opportunities to foster positive creativity and growth in the people I work with.<br>
                <br>
                I invest my spare time in extra education and personal projects to keep my skills sharp and up-to-date.<br>
                <br>
