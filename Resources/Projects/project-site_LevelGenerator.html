            I spent a year on and off building a procedural level generator in Unreal Engine 5<br><br>

            I've had a strong interest in procedural techniques for content generation for many years now but haven't<br>
            had many opportunities to pursue them with significant time investment until this project.<br>
            <br>
            This was actually a feature I wanted to test in <a>Project EWA</a>, but I didn't want to burden the project if it didn't work out.<br>

            <h4>Future goals for the project:</h4>
                <li>Improve the usability of the level configs so generating different level types is easier.</li>
                <li>Add support for more diverse gameplay mechanics</li>
                <li>I would like to work with a 3D artist to see how well it would support different art styles</li>
                <li>Exteriors and structures which don't conform to a square grid</li>

                It was important for me to design this in such a way where it could be integrated with some gameplay mechanics so that
                it didn't simply live as a tech demo that I wouldn't be able to carry over into other projects.
                <br><br>
                I spent some time integrating the generated level with connections to bespoke levels which presented many challenges.
                <br>
                There is a simple quest system integrated into the game that will generate quests, which the level generator will
                then reference to generate the level. It will ensure that a room is created to support the quest so that the objective
                can be completed.

                This is an overview of the stages of the generation process.<br><br>
                First an abstract data strucutre of map data is generated, then the map is instantiated from that data.<br>
                The map data is a serializable struct that can be used to save a generated level to be re-used later if you wanted to reload the same layout at a later time.<br>



                <br>
                The level's layout can be determined by defining Configuration's which exist as uassets.

                <h3>Themes</h3>
                Themes are defined as modular objects as well.
                Every phase of the map generation process can reference the theme to determine which assets to use.<br>
                The screenshots above showcase different themes being applied to rooms.<br>
