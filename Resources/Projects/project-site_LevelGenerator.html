            I spent a year on and off building a procedural level generator in Unreal Engine 5<br><br>

            I've had a strong interest in procedural techniques for content generation for many years now but haven't<br>
            had many opportunities to pursue them with significant time investment until this project.<br>
            <br>
            This was actually a feature I wanted to test in <a>Project EWA</a>, but I didn't want to burden the project if it didn't work out.<br>

                It was important for me to design this in such a way where it could be integrated with some gameplay mechanics so that
                it didn't simply live as a tech demo that I wouldn't be able to carry over into other projects.
                <br><br>
                So I spent some time integrating the generated level with connections to bespoke levels which presented many challenges.
                <br>
                There is a simple quest system integrated into the game that will generate quests, which the level generator will
                then reference to generate the level. It will ensure that a room is created to support the quest so that the objective
                can be completed.
