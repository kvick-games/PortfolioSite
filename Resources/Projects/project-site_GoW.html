        I worked on the UI team to create the menus for the game for the majority of my time at Sony.<br>
        I also worked on development tools, narrative scripting and QA.<br>
        I was largely responsible for technical design and implementation of the primary Game Menu:
        <br><br>
        <li>
        Weapons,
        Armor,
        Huldra Shop,
        Skills, 
        Map, 
        Goals, 
        Codex,
        Resources
        </li>
        <br><br>
        I worked very closely with each member of the core UI team:
        Bryce Mercado, Paul Calvert, and Andy Lang.<br>
        <br>
        Bryce was the Senior UI Designer and built what I would consider much of the backbone of the UI.<br>
        I was responsible and focused more on the elements that were a bit more forward-facing to the player.<br>

        <br><br>

        The UI was built from a combination of lua and C++ in Sony's proprietary engine.
        I built camera and generalized UI blending systems for animating UI elements,<br> 
        state machines for the menus which controlled character animations and camera positions.<br> 
        

        <br><br>

        The project was a constant battle against time and deadlines to be able to squeeze as many extra features in as possible
        to make the interface as usable and intuitive as possible.

        <h2>Inventory Menus</h2>
        I honestly can't recall the number of times that we had to re-arrange the inventory menus.<br>
        <br>
        In the end we landed on a splitting of Weapons and Armor into 2 separate tabs for simplicity.<br>
        <br>
        The design of the UI was a constant battle of finding clarity in a sea of information that we wanted the players to be aware of.<br>
        Up to this point, this game was by far the most information that had ever need to be communicated to the players in a God of War game.<br>
        <br>
        At one point I was requested by a designer if we could put 5 runes in an armor item, unfortunately I had to decline this request as we<br>
        were swimming in bugs. Had I known it would be used for a certain easter egg, I would have made it happen. ;)<br>
        <br>
        Many parts of the UI were built with modular components in mind.<br>
        This allowed us to easily re-use widgets and combine them to create new contexts for different menus with similar items.<br>
        This helped majorly when it came time to split the inventory into two separate menus.<br>
        <br>
        By the time I had joined the UI team, there was practically no UI in the game.<br>
        Just a menu framework, and a few tiny text descriptions of items.<br>

        <h2>Skills Menu</h2>

        Most of the UI is implemented with discrete selection for buttons but I spent a weekend prototyping a free-moving cursor 
        with magnetism and snapping in Unity and brought it in to pitch to the technical director.
        This made the experience of using the skill tree so much more fluid and intuitive, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.<br>
        <br>
        A lot of subtle tricks were implemented to make the cursor feel like it would jump straight to
        the intended skill node with minimal effort from the user.<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately I don't work at Sony anymore so I don't have access to my debug options to be able to showcase 
        the exact functions hidden behind how the cursor works. But I am going to make a simple tutorial on this site to explain how it works in the future.<br>
        <br>
        I also integrated Bink video playback with the assistance of the amazing Bob Soper for the skill tree to help demonstrate the moves to assist the player in making decisions.<br>
        This was a feature that originally wasn't going to make it in time, but the team came together to make all these little additions happen to make the experience that extra bit better.<br>

        I was involved with the team in conducting many rounds of user playtesting and feedback to iterate on the design and discover where
        people were getting stuck or confused.<br>

        I witnessed multiple rounds of playtesters gradually go from being lost, confused, and frustrated to being engaged, excited, and
        enthusiastic about the game as things came together.<br>
        <br>

        Every bit of font size, typeface, kerning, color, and placement was scrutinized and debated over to make sure the player could easily find what they were looking for.<br>
        <br>
        We re-evaluated the entire flow of the menus multiple times until we were confident that the player could easily navigate the game without getting lost.<br>
