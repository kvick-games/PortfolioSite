        This is a game I've been working on for the past few years.<br><br>
        There is a lot of work done on the game, but still much left to go.<br><br>

        I plan on creating some form of public development blog to show off pieces of the game in the future.

            <h2>Cooking System</h2>
            I designed the cooking system to be more flexible than a typical crafting system.
            Dishes do not necessarily require specific ingredients but generic criteria for crafting.
            <br><br>
            Recipes contain a list of criteria that the ingredients must meet to be considered for the dish.
            This allows for a very dynamic and scalable crafting system where the design can accomodate an arbitrary
            number of rules for what must be input to create a dish.
            <br><br>
            A criteria can be defined as specifically requiring a grilled carrot, or more generally, a grilled vegetable,
            or a carrot of any particular quality. This allows for the design to be very flexible and accomodate a wide
            variety of crafting possibilities.

            <h2>Quest System</h2>

            The quest system contains the capability to generate quests dynamically as well as bespoke quests.

                <h2>Simulation-Driven World</h2>
                The game is meant to feel alive and dynamic. There is a day/night cycle, weather, and seasons.
                Any actor can contain a Modifier component which will define behavior to update their simulation state.
                <br><br>
                An example of this would be the Freshness component.
                <br><br>
                The Freshness component will update based on a variety of Influences.
                Influences are defined and can be defined by things such as temperature, time, and other factors.
                <br><br>
                The screenshot here shows the active simulation components and accompanyting influences for an apple on a tree.

            <h2>Utility Scoring System</h2>
            The utility scoring system is a generic system for implementing weighted-random based decisions
            in the game. It can be ported across projects easily as it doesn't rely on any specific game mechanics.

            It is heavily used in the AI system to determine how the NPCs behave.

                <h2>NPCs</h2>
                The game contains a diverse cast of NPCs that visit the player's restaurant.
                NPCs contain unique behaviors and personalities that affect how they interact with the player and the world.
                <br><br>
                They offer quests, buy items, and provide the player with feedback on their restaurant.

                <h2>Building Mechanics</h2>
                The game features a building system where the player can construct their restaurant.
                <br><br>
                Many structures require the player to fetch resources to build them.
                <br><br>
                The player can also upgrade their restaurant to increase the number of customers they can serve.
