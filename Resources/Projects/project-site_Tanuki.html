        This is a game I've been working on for the past few years.<br><br>
        There is a lot of work done on the game, but still much left to go.<br><br>

        I plan on creating some form of public development blog to show off pieces of the game in the future.

        <h1>Main Features:</h1><br><br>

        <br>
        <h2>Utility Scoring System</h2><br>
        The utility scoring system is a generic system for implementing weighted-random based decisions
        in the game. It can be ported across projects easily as it doesn't rely on any specific game mechanics.

        It is heavily used in the AI system to determine how the NPCs behave.
