        This is a game I've been working on for the past few years.<br><br>
        There is a lot of work done on the game, but still much left to go.<br><br>

        I plan on creating some form of public development blog to show off pieces of the game in the future.

        <h1>Main Features:</h1>

        General Purpose Utility-Based Scoring System<br>
        NPC AI<br>
        Simulation-Driven World<br>
            Day/Night Cycle<br>
        Equipment System<br>
        Cooking System<br>
        Dialogue System<br>
        Dynamic Quest System<br>
        Restaurant Building Mechanics<br>
        Fishing<br>
        Farming<br>

        <br>
        <h2>Cooking System</h2>
        I designed the cooking system to be more flexible than a typical crafting system.
        Dishes do not necessarily require specific ingredients but categories of ingredients.

        Recipes contain a list of criteria that the ingredients must meet to be considered for the dish.
        This allows for a very dynamic and scalable crafting system where the design can accomodate an arbitrary
        number of rules for what must be input to create a dish.

        A criteria can be defined as specifically requiring specifically, a grilled carrot, or more generally, a grilled vegetable,
        or a carrot of any particular quality.

        <h2>Simulation-Driven World</h2>
        The game is meant to feel alive and dynamic. There is a day/night cycle, weather, and seasons.
        Actor can contain a Modifier component which will define behavior to update their simulation state.
        <br>
        An example of this would be the Freshness component.
        <br>
        The Freshness component will update based on a variety of Influences.
        Influences are defined and can be defined by things such as temperature, time, and other factors.

        <br>
        <h2>Utility Scoring System</h2>
        The utility scoring system is a generic system for implementing weighted-random based decisions
        in the game. It can be ported across projects easily as it doesn't rely on any specific game mechanics.

        It is heavily used in the AI system to determine how the NPCs behave.
